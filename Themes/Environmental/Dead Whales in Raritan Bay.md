NOAA and Marine Mammal Commission say there is no evidence these deaths are caused by sea floor mapping.

>The sound sources used in HRG surveys are much lower in energy than seismic airguns (Used for oil deposits) and have other important characteristics that set them apart from seismic airguns. Scientists from BOEM recently co-authored a scientific paper that describes key physical attributes of HRG sources – such as beamwidth, exposure duration, and frequency – that make them unlikely to result in incidental take of marine mammals. The paper and a video describing its findings can be found on BOEM’s website at: https://www.boem.gov/environment/center-marine-acoustics-recent-work#tabs-4126
