These are the picks I would have *rather* the jets made than what they did. My picks are made at the same time the jets pick.

| Year | Round | Pick              | My Pick       | Jets Pick |
| ---- | ----- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------- |
|2022| 1    | 4     | Kayvon Thibodeaux | Sauce Gardner |           
|2022| 1    | 10    | Garrett Wilson    | Garett Wilson |
