- Predict what days of the year an Airbnb is likely to sell  
- Wake up times in different cities d3  
	- city profile that includes street orientations  
- Google location data for flight wait times
- dimensionality reduction for food nutrients  
- mapping clothes to microplastic emissions in wash  
- RL for intrusion detection
- Use dimensionality reduction to map countries to each other, accross years too. See if you can use data to answer (does history repeat itself?)
	- Population curves  
	- GDP etc
- RL for student teacher learning  
	- providing different responses based on students current understanding
- Analyze Satelitte imagery for parking spots. run streaming. demonstrate ability to do this in production.
- Fine tuned LLM on government RFPs
- train  a language model to predict price for healthcare operation from hospital
	- https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-12-02-open-source-hospital-price-transparency/
	- do it using SM  
	- train using categorical features as baseline  
	- Then incorporate embeddings with description words
	- explore usefulness of cohere api
	- Limitation: users describing their condition is different than what a hospital may put down  
	- make a streamlit app  
- Project Idea  
	- Build a baseline ml repo based on PdM and cookie cutter ds. build in MLFow integration, sphinx, etc. with vs code settings. add the model registry.
