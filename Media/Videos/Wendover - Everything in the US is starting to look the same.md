# Everything in the US is starting to look the same
# Factors    
-   national chains have standardized layouts and looks that show no regional differences 
-   Consolidation in multinational developers has reduced variety
-   Regulations encourage economically the building of 5 over 1's. 5 wooden floors over a concrete lower floor. This is based on a loophole in fire code.
-  Traveling people prefer comfort. You can find the bathroom in any restaurant, the lobby or pool in any Mariott.
