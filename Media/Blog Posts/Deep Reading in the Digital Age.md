Reading is not just about informing. It should empower the user to think, draw connections, synthesize information, update beliefs, cross check against past information.

Modern reading does not lend itself to this.

Information left on the device does not become knowledge, and does not become wisdom.

Any idea worth knowing and contemplating cannot be thought about in the span of reading a tweet or a reddit post. Books not only give more information, but more time to think.

Digital Gardening presents a solution to this. Possibly it is something worth pursuing in [[Education]].

## Speed Reading
Even a summary (ironic) of a book I read on speed reading encourages periodic recall and syntesis in order to increase comprehension.
