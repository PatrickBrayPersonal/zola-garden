### The Bitter Lesson
http://incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html
Sutton :goat: advocates that methodologies that focus on scaling with compute will always outperform that use clever human knowledge. 
Scaling better with compute matters even with the death of moore's law. There is still room for human ingenuity but it should be focused on maximizing learning through compute more efficiently, rather than leading the learner to heuristics.
